* What's two way binding?
  * Two-way binding means that any data-related changes affecting the model are immediately propagated to the matching view(s), and that any changes made in the view(s) (say, by the user) are immediately reflected in the underlying model. When app data changes, so does the UI, and conversely.
* What's ng-model?
  * The ngModel directive binds an input,select, textarea (or custom form control) to a property on the scope. 
* What is `$http`?
  * A service for making AJAX calls via the HTTP protocol
* What is ng-repeat?
  * Used for repeating a set of elements and iterating over a collection. 
* What are `$index`, `$even`, `$odd`, `$first`, and `$last`?
  * $index - The index of the current element.
  * $first - Boolean indicating if the element is first in the collection.
  * $middle - Boolean indicating if the element is neither first nor last in the collection.
  * $last - Boolean indicating if the element is last in the collection.
  * $even - Boolean indicating if the element's index is even.
  * $odd - Boolean indicating if the element's index is odd. 
* How would you filter a list via ng-repeat?
  * div class="row col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 productBorder"
		ng-repeat="product in products | orderBy:'name' | filter:search" (search is a scope variable)
* What's the difference between `angular.module('app' , [])` and `angular.module('app')`
  * first one creates a module injecting the dependency modules. second is used to reference the creation of controllers and directives. 
* What are directives (briefly)? 
  * At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children. 
* Why would you use ng-submit instead of ng-click in some cases?
  * The ngSubmit directive binds to the submit event in the browser, which is fired when a form is submitted. The ngClick directive allows you to specify custom behavior when an element is clicked. (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23553071/differences-between-ng-submit-and-ng-click) 
* What's Dependency Injection?
  * Where you do not create the dependencies required instead have the framework provide it to you.
* Do other frameworks use dependency injection (even if only for internal use)? Answer: yes (React,Ember)
* How would you inject services and what are the different ways to do so?
 * Passing a dependency as Function Arguments, Passing a dependency as Array Arguments, Passing a dependency using the $inject service (http://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/dhananjay_kumar/archive/2016/02/28/different-ways-of-injecting-dependency-in-an-angularjs-application.aspx) 
* What's jqLite?
 * jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way. jqLite implements only the most commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint. 
* How do you ensure Angular uses jQuery when including them both?
 * To use jQuery , simply ensure it is loaded before the angular.js file.  
* What are promises and how would you use them?
 * A promise represents the eventual result of an operation. You can use a promise to specify what to do when an operation eventually succeeds or fails. Using $q. (http://www.dwmkerr.com/promises-in-angularjs-the-definitive-guide/) 
* What's the difference between factory/provider/service/value/constant?
 * Factory returns an object. Services do not return an object. Providers have a $.get function() which returns an object. 
* When would you use each one?
 * https://gist.github.com/demisx/9605099 
* What are filters?
 * Filters can be added in AngularJS to format and transform data. (http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_filters.asp)

 * https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCloak 
* What's the difference between ng-if and ng-show?
 * If ng-if is used on an element, then it won't be included in the DOM, but for ng-show the element is present just its display is none. 
* What phases are there in angular? Answer: config -> bootstrap -> run
* Why would you use `.config()` and `.run()` phase?
 * Config block is executed during the provider registration and configuration phase. We can have these as many as we want in the application. Only providers and constants can be injected into configuration blocks and not instances. Run block is executed after the execution of configuration block. It inserts instances and constants but not providers. This block is created using run() method.

* What's ui-router and why use it over ng-route?
 * ui-router is a 3rd-party module and is very powerful. It supports everything the normal ngRoute can do as well as many extra functions.
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21023763/angularjs-difference-between-angular-route-and-angular-ui-router
* What are states?
 * A state corresponds to a "place" in the application in terms of the overall UI and navigation. A state (via the controller / template / view properties) describes what the UI looks like and does at that place.

 * http://www.codeandyou.com/2015/09/what-is-rootscope-in-angularjs.html
* What is `"$destroy"`?
 * Angular will broadcast a $destroy event just before tearing down a scope and removing the scope from its parent. Listening for this event is crucial for cleaning up tasks and resources that otherwise might continue to chew up memory or CPU.
 * http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2013/07/16/angularjs-listening-for-destroy.aspx
